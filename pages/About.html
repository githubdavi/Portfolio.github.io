        <p>
            My name is Valerius David, since my childhood, I always been passionate about the world of computer science,
            my curiosity pushed me to explore and research web development technologies. I was captivated by how
            technology can transform lines of code into interactive and functional experiences. Today, as a junior web
            developer, I continuing my studies in a professional MIAW web development license on a work-study basis,
            which allowed me to have my first real experience in this field thanks to the company eBrigade where I was
            able to participate to the improvement and maintenance of an online site. My journey reflects my
            determination to master programming languages, solve complex problems, and contribute meaningfully to the
            world of web development. Every line of code I write is an opportunity to learn and grow, and I aspire to
            continue expanding my skills to shape the digital future with creativity and innovation.
            After my studies I see myself working either as a freelancer or in a web development company where life will
            be good!
